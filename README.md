# NIKE monitor
### *1. Currently implemented functionality*
* **"product.py" :** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use "requests" to access nike's api. Get the latest sneaker sale information.
* **"wechat.py" :** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use "itchat" to login to the web page WeChat. Send the latest sneaker information to a friend or group.
* **"main.py" :** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know its usefulness.

### *2. Current problems*
* **(1) nike's api is really difficult. There are several keys that don't know what it means. I hope I can crack it later.**
* **(2) Only shoes can be monitored now. Unable to submit orders and purchases.**

### *3. What I hope to achieve in the future*
* **(1) Put the program on the "wechat mini program".**
* **(2) It is possible to monitor new shoes to inform users.**
* **(3) Automatic login. Automatically submit orders.**
* **(4) etc... More advanced features.**

###### I used to think that code can change the world. It was later discovered that there were only a handful of people who changed the world. The code changes only myself.
